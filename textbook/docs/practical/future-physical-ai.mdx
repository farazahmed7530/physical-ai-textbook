```python
class RobotFoundationModel:
    """
    Conceptual architecture for a robot foundation model.
    Combines language, vision, and action in a unified framework.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.language_encoder = LanguageEncoder()
        self.vision_encoder = VisionEncoder()
        self.action_decoder = ActionDecoder()
        self.world_model = WorldModel()

    def process_instruction(self,
                           instruction: str,
                           visual_observation: np.ndarray,
                           robot_state: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Process natural language instruction with visual context.

        Returns:
            Action sequence to execute
        """
        # Encode instruction
        lang_embedding = self.language_encoder.encode(instruction)

        # Encode visual scene
        vision_embedding = self.vision_encoder.encode(visual_observation)

        # Fuse modalities
        fused_representation = self._fuse_modalities(
            lang_embedding, vision_embedding, robot_state
        )

        # Predict action sequence
        actions = self.action_decoder.decode(fused_representation)

        # Verify with world model
        predicted_outcome = self.world_model.simulate(
            robot_state, actions
        )

        return {
            'actions': actions,
            'predicted_outcome': predicted_outcome,
            'confidence': self._compute_confidence(actions)
        }

    def learn_from_demonstration(self, demonstrations: list):
        """Learn new skills from human demonstrations."""
        for demo in demonstrations:
            # Extract state-action pairs
            states = demo['states']
            actions = demo['actions']
            instruction = demo['instruction']

            # Update model

    """Individual robot in a swarm system."""

    def __init__(self, robot_id: int, communication_range: float):
        self.id = robot_id
        self.comm_range = communication_range
        self.position = np.random.rand(2) * 100
        self.velocity = np.zeros(2)
        self.neighbors = []

    def update(self, all_robots: list):
        """

        Implements Reynolds flocking rules:
        - Separation: Avoid crowding neighbors

        """
        self._find_neighbors(all_robots)

        alignment = self._compute_alignment()

        # Cohesion
        cohesion = self._compute_cohesion()

        # Combine behaviors
        self.velocity += (
            1.5 * separation +
            1.0 * alignment +
            1.0 * cohesion
        )

        # Limit speed
        speed = np.linalg.norm(self.velocity)
        if speed > 5.0:
            self.velocity = self.velocity / speed * 5.0

        # Update position

    def _find_neighbors(self, all_robots: list):
        """Find robots within communication range."""
        self.neighbors = [
            r for r in all_robots
            if r.id != self.id and
            np.linalg.norm(r.position - self.position) < self.comm_range

                steer += diff / (dist * dist)  # Inverse square
        return steer
```
